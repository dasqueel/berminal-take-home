# Initial thoughts

Thought a table would be an appropiate

Never have used React-Table before, and found there would be cool features of using it.
Such as sorting, searching and pagination of data.

A downside to a table would be all the information you need to convey, will it all fit?

# Would work on futher:
* make the adding a new coin, its own components
* fix the bug that all 100 coins get listed on the initial render
* configure sorting algorithm for ints, right now its based off strings
* ~~add a column for Social Media links, which have clickable links, instead of the string url~~
* create a profile page for each coin, which can be accessed through the coin name or ticker column value
* a modal for adding a new coin, instead of the form at the top of the page
* createa unique Id generator for when creating an id for a new coin
* ~~create a popover for the active investors column.  The popover would list all the investors~~
